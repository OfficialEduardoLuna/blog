# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

This theme is based on the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).


A blog in 2020? More likely than you think. I chose Github Pages because I wanted to have more control over something like tumblr, and medium, but I do not want to mainain a server right now.

I may invest in a dedicated server down the line, but my blog will stay here. This blog will be static markup, and github is a very reliable host that offers awesome student discounts (and freebies). 
What can you expect to find on this blog? Not sure yet. But they will somehow relate to the tech in my life, unless otherwise noted.
Feel free to follow me on an RSS reader, but I will mostly just be using this as a platform to link to from my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eduardolunaHTX).
